The second of four brothers, his father was an employee of Miyazaki Airplane, a family-run business. During World War II, his family moved to Utsunomiya and Kanuma due to wartime evacuations. His family ran an airplane factory, a military enterprise, which allowed them a relatively comfortable life even during the material shortages of the war's latter stages. Miyazaki had a rather free childhood. However, growing up in such an environment, Miyazaki developed unexpected doubts about his family's privileged status. He learned from his father that the airplane tails produced by their factory, made by untrained temporary female workers, did not meet the standards and were only approved through bribing military officials. These adult compromises, seemingly trivial to others, left an indelible mark on Miyazaki and spurred his reflections on human nature, influencing his later work as an animation director. Due to his poor health in childhood, Miyazaki was not fond of physical activities but showed a remarkable talent for static drawing, particularly airplanes, which became a lifelong passion.",(0,t.jsx)("br",{}),(0,t.jsx)("br",{}),"Hayao Miyazaki is a legend in the Japanese animation industry, a figure whose absence would significantly diminish the field. He was the first to elevate animation to a humanistic level, serving as a spiritual pillar bridging three generations of Japanese animators. While breaking away from the shadow of Osamu Tezuka, Miyazaki set an example for future animators with his resolute character and uncompromising struggle. Tracing back to \"Howl's Moving Castle,\" it's universally acknowledged that Miyazaki is a central pillar of the Japanese animation industry, an exemplary pragmatist. His artistic language is far from avant-garde; he patiently refined others' experiments. Yet, it was his technique that made more people appreciate it. Perhaps Miyazaki understood that to awaken the world, his language needed to be gentle, as too harsh a cry might cause fragile humanity to cover its ears. Perhaps Miyazaki suffered for his pragmatism, preventing him from being a pioneer, but he benefitted more from it, becoming a harvester instead. Moreover, he perfectly balanced reality and imagination, showing the beauty of an imagined world, as splendid as a fantasy.",(0,t.jsx)("br",{}),(0,t.jsx)("br",{}),"His works are like opening a vast skylight in the narrow confines of the human mind, involuntarily making one believe in the power of dreams, for the existence of dreams is what allows humanity to stand shoulder to shoulder with gods.
