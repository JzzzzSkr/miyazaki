The second of four brothers, his\n          father was an employee of Miyazaki Airplane, a family-run business.\n          During World War II, his family moved to Utsunomiya and Kanuma due to\n          wartime evacuations. His family ran an airplane factory, a military\n          enterprise, which allowed them a relatively comfortable life even\n          during the material shortages of the war's latter stages. Miyazaki had\n          a rather free childhood. However, growing up in such an environment,\n          Miyazaki developed unexpected doubts about his family's privileged\n          status. He learned from his father that the airplane tails produced by\n          their factory, made by untrained temporary female workers, did not\n          meet the standards and were only approved through bribing military\n          officials. These adult compromises, seemingly trivial to others, left\n          an indelible mark on Miyazaki and spurred his reflections on human\n          nature, influencing his later work as an animation director. Due to\n          his poor health in childhood, Miyazaki was not fond of physical\n          activities but showed a remarkable talent for static drawing,\n          particularly airplanes, which became a lifelong passion.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          Hayao Miyazaki is a legend in the Japanese animation industry, a\n          figure whose absence would significantly diminish the field. He was\n          the first to elevate animation to a humanistic level, serving as a\n          spiritual pillar bridging three generations of Japanese animators.\n          While breaking away from the shadow of Osamu Tezuka, Miyazaki set an\n          example for future animators with his resolute character and\n          uncompromising struggle. Tracing back to \"Howl's Moving Castle,\" it's\n          universally acknowledged that Miyazaki is a central pillar of the\n          Japanese animation industry, an exemplary pragmatist. His artistic\n          language is far from avant-garde; he patiently refined others'\n          experiments. Yet, it was his technique that made more people\n          appreciate it. Perhaps Miyazaki understood that to awaken the world,\n          his language needed to be gentle, as too harsh a cry might cause\n          fragile humanity to cover its ears. Perhaps Miyazaki suffered for his\n          pragmatism, preventing him from being a pioneer, but he benefitted\n          more from it, becoming a harvester instead. Moreover, he perfectly\n          balanced reality and imagination, showing the beauty of an imagined\n          world, as splendid as a fantasy.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          His works are like opening a vast skylight in the narrow confines of\n          the human mind, involuntarily making one believe in the power of\n          dreams, for the existence of dreams is what allows humanity to stand\n          shoulder to shoulder with gods. From his earliest works, Miyazaki's\n          philosophy has been consistent and dialectically evolving. His\n          worldview, historical view, life view, and artistic view all follow a\n          clear trajectory, all aimed at constructing the perfect world of\n          Miyazaki.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"down\">\n        <p>\n          <strong>A Quest for Perfection and Childhood Dreams</strong>\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          Many people first hear of the name before they know the works. Such\n          individuals who have transcended their creations possess a mysterious\n          charm that draws others irresistibly.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          The documentary chronicles the four years of creation from 2006 to\n          2010, narrated in English. It covers, but is not limited to, the\n          behind-the-scenes stories of \"Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea\" and \"The\n          Wind Rises,\" as well as two films by his son Goro Miyazaki: \"Tales\n          from Earthsea\" and \"From Up on Poppy Hill.\"\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          In terms of filming techniques, it differs from large production crews\n          with their multi-angle, multi-camera descriptions. There are no fancy\n          camera movements. Instead, the film was shot by photographer Arakawa,\n          who followed the elder Miyazaki with a handheld camera. The narrative\n          is presented in the first person, and the editing is rather plain,\n          with only subtitles added. This approach oddly elevates the film's\n          sense of authenticity.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          It shows a side that all creators possess. In these four condensed\n          forty-minute episodes, you can see him flipping through storyboards\n          repeatedly, shaking his legs irritably, muttering \"what a hassle\" and\n          \"this isn't right\" while discarding freshly drawn frames. He instructs\n          animators: \"Add three more frames here, it will look more natural\";\n          about a storyboard frame where Ponyo hugs Sosuke: \"The line I'm\n          looking for is somewhere here, every line has its place, if I can find\n          it, I can convey the feeling of 'holding tightly'. The toes should be\n          more spread out, she never wears shoes, the clothes should be tighter\n          around here because of the tight hug (flipping through the\n          storyboard).\"\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          \"You have to constantly push yourself, drive yourself to the limit,\n          and then see what you have created. Most people can't do this,\" he\n          says.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          This is just less than a thirtieth of the content of the four-part\n          documentary. Seeking simplicity but far from simple, each frame is\n          close to life and full of creativity; meticulously sculpting every\n          little action. With a passionate and warm heart, relentlessly pursuing\n          and perfecting his own goals; extremely strict about details, he is\n          using all his strength to perfect the world he has created, every\n          world. Strong, unyielding, constantly striving for perfection, full of\n          creativity, relentless. Feeling angry, anxious during the creative\n          process... This is one facet of all creators, and perhaps the best\n          facet.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          This is the tone of the entire documentary: an almost obsessive\n          artist, a living, breathing human being.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          Epilogue: \"I don't want to keep up with the world's pace because I\n          still want them to see childhood.\"\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default About;\n"],"names":["About","_jsxs","className","children","_jsx"],"sourceRoot":""}
