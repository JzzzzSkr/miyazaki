One day, after a quarrel with her sister, Mei runs away to find their hospitalized mother but gets lost. Satsuki, unable to find her, seeks help from Totoro. The kind and gentle Totoro summons the Catbus, which helps Satsuki find her lost sister. Riding on the Totoro\'s "aircraft," Mei delivers a corn cob she picked herself to her mother, hoping for her swift recovery. Totoro can both fly through the air and make seeds grow into giant trees instantly. He can also call upon the fast-moving Catbus. On starry nights, Totoro can be seen sitting atop the forest, playing a small ocarina. Totoro\'s magical powers greatly impress and inspire Satsuki and Mei. However, not everyone can see Totoro; only pure-hearted children can meet him.',(0,i.jsx)("br",{}),(0,i.jsx)("br",{}),"The film's beautiful visuals are filled with the fresh atmosphere of rural countryside, but it does not lack thrilling moments.
