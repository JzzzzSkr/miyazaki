The main\n                  voice cast includes Rumi Hiiragi, Miyu Irino, Takashi Naito,\n                  and Mari Natsuki. The film premiered in Japan on July 20,\n                  2001, and in mainland China on June 21, 2019, and tells the\n                  story of a young girl named Chihiro who accidentally enters\n                  the world of spirits and undergoes numerous trials to save her\n                  parents, who have been transformed into pigs as punishment. A\n                  digitally remastered version was re-released in Taiwan on\n                  August 5, 2022.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  Chihiro, a somewhat spoiled 10-year-old girl (voiced by Rumi\n                  Hiiragi), is moving to a new home with her parents. On the\n                  way, they accidentally enter a shrine leading to another\n                  world: a bustling bathhouse street serving gods and spirits.\n                  Her parents, having eaten food meant for the gods, are turned\n                  into pigs. Chihiro, in a panic, is saved by a boy named Haku\n                  (voiced by Miyu Irino). With Haku's help, Chihiro finds refuge\n                  and works for the witch Yubaba (voiced by Mari Natsuki), who\n                  runs the town's central bathhouse. In order to save her\n                  parents and return to her own world, Chihiro must work for\n                  Yubaba, who takes her name and renames her \"Sen.\" During her\n                  time there, she is guided by Lin (voiced by Yumi Tamai),\n                  helped by Kamaji the boiler man (voiced by Bunta Sugawara),\n                  encounters creatures like the soot sprites and the mysterious\n                  No-Face, and makes many new friends. Ultimately, Chihiro saves\n                  Haku and discovers his true identity. However, to save her\n                  parents, she must face a severe test.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  The film narrates Chihiro's journey of facing society alone\n                  and growing up, serving as a \"growth gift\" from Miyazaki to\n                  audiences of all ages. Particularly relevant during exam\n                  seasons, \"Spirited Away\" is like a rite of passage into\n                  adulthood. The first stage of growth involves entering an\n                  unfamiliar environment and feeling panicked, much like\n                  Chihiro's initial reaction to the spirit world. The second\n                  stage is about facing temptations and making choices,\n                  symbolized by characters like No-Face, who becomes a monster,\n                  and Chihiro, who stays true to herself. The final stage\n                  represents the inevitable goodbyes of growth, like the one-way\n                  train in the movie, symbolizing that people can only accompany\n                  you for part of your journey, and you must bid farewell when\n                  they depart.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"right\">\n          <ul>\n            <li className=\"character\">\n              <img src=\"./assets/qyqx-3.jpg\" alt=\"Haku \" />\n              <span>Haku (White Dragon)</span>\n            </li>\n            <li className=\"character\">\n              <img src=\"./assets/qyqx-4.jpg\" alt=\"Chihiro \" />\n              <span>Chihiro Ogino (Sen)</span>\n            </li>\n            <li className=\"character\">\n              <img src=\"./assets/qyqx-5.jpg\" alt=\"Yubaba \" />\n              <span>Yubaba</span>\n            </li>\n            <li className=\"character\">\n              <img src=\"./assets/qyqx-6.jpg\" alt=\"No-Face \" />\n              <span>No Face</span>\n            </li>\n            <li className=\"character\">\n              <img src=\"./assets/qyqx-7.jpg\" alt=\"Boh \" />\n              <span>Boh (Yubaba's Baby)</span>\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Spirited;\n"],"names":["Spirited","_jsxs","className","children","_jsx","src","alt"],"sourceRoot":""}
