It was\n                  released in Japan on July 20, 2013. Set in Japan during the\n                  1920s, the film narrates the story of Jiro Horikoshi, known as\n                  the \"Father of Japanese Aviation,\" focusing on his life as a\n                  young engineer and his encounter with a girl named Naoko\n                  Satomi.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  Spanning the Taisho and early Showa periods, the 1920s and 30s\n                  in Japan were times of turmoil, with poverty, disease,\n                  economic depression, and the devastating Great Kanto\n                  Earthquake. As war approached, the future for the young\n                  generation became increasingly uncertain and elusive. Jiro\n                  Horikoshi (voiced by Hideaki Anno), who had a lifelong\n                  fascination with airplanes, formed a transcendent friendship\n                  with the Italian airplane designer Caproni (voiced by Mansai\n                  Nomura), drawing courage and inspiration from him. Jiro vowed\n                  to design and build beautiful airplanes, eventually attending\n                  a university in Tokyo to study aeronautical engineering. He\n                  later studied in Germany and became a combat aircraft\n                  designer, creating the classic \"Type 0 Carrier Fighter,\" a\n                  testament to his ingenuity. However, during a test flight, his\n                  plane crashed, deeply affecting him. He went to Karuizawa in\n                  Nagano for recuperation and there met the love of his life,\n                  Naoko Satomi (voiced by Miori Takimoto), whom he had\n                  encountered once during the Great Kanto Earthquake of\n                  September 1, 1923. They fell in love at first sight and\n                  pledged to be together forever. However, Naoko was suffering\n                  from tuberculosis, a terminal illness at the time, casting a\n                  shadow over their future. Despite this, Jiro remained\n                  committed to his dream of building beautiful airplanes,\n                  throwing himself back into the design of the Zero Fighter.\n                  Meanwhile, Naoko, aware her days were numbered, secretly left\n                  the sanatorium to be with her beloved Jiro. In these turbulent\n                  times, their fragile love flickered like a candle in the wind.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  The beautiful work of Hori Tatsuo raises the question of why\n                  he chose a line from a poem by the French poet Paul Valéry for\n                  the title. Indeed, \"The Wind Rises\" as a phrase is emotionally\n                  neutral, but knowing that the next line of the poem is \"we\n                  must try to live,\" it becomes difficult to claim that \"The\n                  Wind Rises\" is merely a calm description of nature. In the\n                  novel, the complete line appears in a scene where Setsuko is\n                  painting outdoors. The wind blows, knocking over her easel,\n                  and her half-finished painting gets leaves stuck to it due to\n                  the wet paint. Setsuko is somewhat panicked, but \"I firmly\n                  held onto you, not letting you leave my side, as if at that\n                  moment I didn't want to lose anything. You let me hold onto\n                  you, not struggling to get away.\" Therefore, the subsequent\n                  recitation of \"The wind is rising; we must try to live\" is\n                  imbued by Hori Tatsuo with this meaning: no matter what\n                  accidents occur, \"I\" and Setsuko will firmly hold onto each\n                  other and walk this path together.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"right\">\n          <ul>\n            <li className=\"character\">\n              <img src=\"./assets/qfl-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n              <span>Naoko Satomi</span>\n            </li>\n            <li className=\"character\">\n              <img src=\"./assets/qfl-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n              <span>Jiro Horikoshi</span>\n            </li>\n            <li className=\"character\">\n              <img src=\"./assets/qfl-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n              <span>Honjo</span>\n            </li>\n            <li className=\"character\">\n              <img src=\"./assets/qfl-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n              <span>Kurokawa</span>\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Wind;\n"],"names":["Wind","_jsxs","className","children","_jsx","src","alt"],"sourceRoot":""}
