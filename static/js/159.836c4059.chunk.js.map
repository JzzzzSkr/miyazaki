The film tells the\n                  story of a little mermaid princess named Ponyo, who falls in\n                  love with a human boy named Sosuke, and her desire to become\n                  human. It was released in Japan on July 19, 2008, and in\n                  mainland China on December 31, 2020. <br />\n                  <br />\n                  Sosuke (voiced by Hiroki Doi), a 5-year-old boy, lives in a\n                  small seaside town on a cliff by the sea with his mother, Lisa\n                  (voiced by Tomoko Yamaguchi). His father, a ship captain, is\n                  often at sea, leaving Sosuke and his mother to rely on each\n                  other. One day, Sosuke finds a glass bottle washed ashore\n                  containing a trapped little goldfish. The goldfish, named\n                  Ponyo (voiced by Yuria Nara), is the daughter of a mermaid\n                  queen. She had been playing with jellyfish and got trapped in\n                  the bottle. Sosuke takes Ponyo home and keeps her in a plastic\n                  container. Pony o enjoys her time at Sosuke's home and grows\n                  fond of him, as he does of her. However, their happiness is\n                  short-lived as Ponyo's father, Fujimoto (voiced by George\n                  Tokoro), a fisherman who became the master of the ocean after\n                  falling in love with the mermaid queen, takes her back to the\n                  ocean. Missing Sosuke deeply, Ponyo decides to become human to\n                  be with him. With the help of her sisters, Ponyo steals her\n                  father's magical elixir and heads towards the human world.\n                  Unexpectedly, the elixir, containing dangerous magical powers,\n                  goes out of control, causing a massive rise in sea level and a\n                  storm, with her sisters transforming into giant fish and\n                  creating waves that head towards the town. Ponyo's innocent\n                  wish leads to a major disaster, and Sosuke, who promised to\n                  protect Ponyo forever, faces a new challenge.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  Despite Ponyo's seemingly outdated mermaid concept, lacking\n                  grand visuals, epic stories, or profound revelations, it\n                  exemplifies the charm of Hayao Miyazaki's animations, helping\n                  viewers rediscover the most beautiful and pure things they\n                  once had. Unlike traditional mermaids, Ponyo is unique. The\n                  film is a narrative set in \"an era of panic and unease,\" about\n                  the emotions of boys and girls, love and responsibility, the\n                  sea and life, and the relationship between fathers and sons.\n                  Compared to Miyazaki's previous works, the film's worldview\n                  and theme are somewhat simpler, but it deeply touches on the\n                  theme of paternal love, reflecting Miyazaki's profound\n                  feelings towards his own son.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"right\">\n          <ul>\n            <li className=\"character\">\n              <img src=\"./assets/bnyzj-3.jpg\" alt=\"Sosuke \" />\n              <span>Sosuke</span>\n            </li>\n            <li className=\"character\">\n              <img src=\"./assets/bnyzj-4.jpg\" alt=\"poyon\" /> <span>Ponyo</span>\n            </li>\n            <li className=\"character\">\n              <img src=\"./assets/bn5.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa \" />\n              <span>Lisa</span>\n            </li>\n            <li className=\"character\">\n              <img src=\"./assets/bn6.jpg\" alt=\"Koichi \" />\n              <span>Koichi</span>\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Ponyo;\n"],"names":["Ponyo","_jsxs","className","children","_jsx","src","alt"],"sourceRoot":""}
