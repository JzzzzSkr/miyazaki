",(0,i.jsx)("br",{}),(0,i.jsx)("br",{}),"Sosuke (voiced by Hiroki Doi), a 5-year-old boy, lives in a small seaside town on a cliff by the sea with his mother, Lisa (voiced by Tomoko Yamaguchi). His father, a ship captain, is often at sea, leaving Sosuke and his mother to rely on each other. One day, Sosuke finds a glass bottle washed ashore containing a trapped little goldfish. The goldfish, named Ponyo (voiced by Yuria Nara), is the daughter of a mermaid queen. She had been playing with jellyfish and got trapped in the bottle. Sosuke takes Ponyo home and keeps her in a plastic container. Pony o enjoys her time at Sosuke's home and grows fond of him, as he does of her. However, their happiness is short-lived as Ponyo's father, Fujimoto (voiced by George Tokoro), a fisherman who became the master of the ocean after falling in love with the mermaid queen, takes her back to the ocean. Missing Sosuke deeply, Ponyo decides to become human to be with him. With the help of her sisters, Ponyo steals her father's magical elixir and heads towards the human world. Unexpectedly, the elixir, containing dangerous magical powers, goes out of control, causing a massive rise in sea level and a storm, with her sisters transforming into giant fish and creating waves that head towards the town. Ponyo's innocent wish leads to a major disaster, and Sosuke, who promised to protect Ponyo forever, faces a new challenge.",(0,i.jsx)("br",{}),(0,i.jsx)("br",{}),"Despite Ponyo's seemingly outdated mermaid concept, lacking grand visuals, epic stories, or profound revelations, it exemplifies the charm of Hayao Miyazaki's animations, helping viewers rediscover the most beautiful and pure things they once had. Unlike traditional mermaids, Ponyo is unique. The film is a narrative set in \"an era of panic and unease,\" about the emotions of boys and girls, love and responsibility, the sea and life, and the relationship between fathers and sons. Compared to Miyazaki's previous works, the film's worldview and theme are somewhat simpler, but it deeply touches on the theme of paternal love, reflecting Miyazaki's profound feelings towards his own son.",(0,i.jsx)("br",{}),(0,i.jsx)("br",{})]})})]})]})]}),(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:"right",children:(0,i.jsxs)("ul",{children:[(0,i.jsxs)("li",{className:"character",children:[(0,i.jsx)("img",{src:"./assets/bnyzj-3.jpg",alt:"Sosuke "}),(0,i.jsx)("span",{children:"Sosuke"})]}),(0,i.jsxs)("li",{className:"character",children:[(0,i.jsx)("img",{src:"./assets/bnyzj-4.jpg",alt:"poyon"})," ",(0,i.jsx)("span",{children:"Ponyo"})]}),(0,i.jsxs)("li",{className:"character",children:[(0,i.jsx)("img",{src:"./assets/bn5.jpg",alt:"Lisa "}),(0,i.jsx)("span",{children:"Lisa"})]}),(0,i.jsxs)("li",{className:"character",children:[(0,i.jsx)("img",{src:"./assets/bn6.jpg",alt:"Koichi "}),(0,i.jsx)("span",{children:"Koichi"})]})]})})]})]})},358:()=>{}}]);
