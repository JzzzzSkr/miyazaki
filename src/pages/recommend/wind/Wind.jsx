                  <strong>"The Wind Rises"</strong> is adapted from a novel of
                  the same name by Hori Tatsuo, as well as a manga, and was
                  produced by Studio Ghibli with direction by Hayao Miyazaki.
                  The film features voice acting by Hideaki Anno, Miori
                  Takimoto, Hidetoshi Nishijima, and Masahiko Nishimura. It was
                  released in Japan on July 20, 2013. Set in Japan during the
                  1920s, the film narrates the story of Jiro Horikoshi, known as
                  the "Father of Japanese Aviation," focusing on his life as a
                  young engineer and his encounter with a girl named Naoko
                  Satomi.

                  Spanning the Taisho and early Showa periods, the 1920s and 30s
                  in Japan were times of turmoil, with poverty, disease,
                  economic depression, and the devastating Great Kanto
                  Earthquake. As war approached, the future for the young
                  generation became increasingly uncertain and elusive. Jiro
                  Horikoshi (voiced by Hideaki Anno), who had a lifelong
                  fascination with airplanes, formed a transcendent friendship
                  with the Italian airplane designer Caproni (voiced by Mansai
                  Nomura), drawing courage and inspiration from him. Jiro vowed
                  to design and build beautiful airplanes, eventually attending
                  a university in Tokyo to study aeronautical engineering. He
                  later studied in Germany and became a combat aircraft
                  designer, creating the classic "Type 0 Carrier Fighter," a
                  testament to his ingenuity. However, during a test flight, his
                  plane crashed, deeply affecting him. He went to Karuizawa in
                  Nagano for recuperation and there met the love of his life,
                  Naoko Satomi (voiced by Miori Takimoto), whom he had
                  encountered once during the Great Kanto Earthquake of
                  September 1, 1923. They fell in love at first sight and
                  pledged to be together forever. However, Naoko was suffering
                  from tuberculosis, a terminal illness at the time, casting a
                  shadow over their future. Despite this, Jiro remained
                  committed to his dream of building beautiful airplanes,
                  throwing himself back into the design of the Zero Fighter.
                  Meanwhile, Naoko, aware her days were numbered, secretly left
                  the sanatorium to be with her beloved Jiro. In these turbulent
                  times, their fragile love flickered like a candle in the wind.

                  <br />
                  The beautiful work of Hori Tatsuo raises the question of why
                  he chose a line from a poem by the French poet Paul Valéry for
                  the title. Indeed, "The Wind Rises" as a phrase is emotionally
                  neutral, but knowing that the next line of the poem is "we
                  must try to live," it becomes difficult to claim that "The
                  Wind Rises" is merely a calm description of nature. In the
                  novel, the complete line appears in a scene where Setsuko is
                  painting outdoors. The wind blows, knocking over her easel,
                  and her half-finished painting gets leaves stuck to it due to
                  the wet paint. Setsuko is somewhat panicked, but "I firmly
                  held onto you, not letting you leave my side, as if at that
                  moment I didn't want to lose anything. You let me hold onto
                  you, not struggling to get away." Therefore, the subsequent
                  recitation of "The wind is rising; we must try to live" is
                  imbued by Hori Tatsuo with this meaning: no matter what
                  accidents occur, "I" and Setsuko will firmly hold onto each
                  other and walk this path together.
