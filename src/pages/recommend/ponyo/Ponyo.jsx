                  <strong>"Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea"</strong> is an
                  animated film produced by Studio Ghibli and directed by Hayao
                  Miyazaki, featuring voice acting by Yuria Nara, Tomoko
                  Yamaguchi, Kazushige Nagashima, and others. The film tells the
                  story of a little mermaid princess named Ponyo, who falls in
                  love with a human boy named Sosuke, and her desire to become
                  human. It was released in Japan on July 19, 2008, and in
                  mainland China on December 31, 2020. <br />
                  <br />
                  Sosuke (voiced by Hiroki Doi), a 5-year-old boy, lives in a
                  small seaside town on a cliff by the sea with his mother, Lisa
                  (voiced by Tomoko Yamaguchi). His father, a ship captain, is
                  often at sea, leaving Sosuke and his mother to rely on each
                  other. One day, Sosuke finds a glass bottle washed ashore
                  containing a trapped little goldfish. The goldfish, named
                  Ponyo (voiced by Yuria Nara), is the daughter of a mermaid
                  queen. She had been playing with jellyfish and got trapped in
                  the bottle. Sosuke takes Ponyo home and keeps her in a plastic
                  container. Pony o enjoys her time at Sosuke's home and grows
                  fond of him, as he does of her. However, their happiness is
                  short-lived as Ponyo's father, Fujimoto (voiced by George
                  Tokoro), a fisherman who became the master of the ocean after
                  falling in love with the mermaid queen, takes her back to the
                  ocean. Missing Sosuke deeply, Ponyo decides to become human to
                  be with him. With the help of her sisters, Ponyo steals her
                  father's magical elixir and heads towards the human world.
                  Unexpectedly, the elixir, containing dangerous magical powers,
                  goes out of control, causing a massive rise in sea level and a
                  storm, with her sisters transforming into giant fish and
                  creating waves that head towards the town. Ponyo's innocent
                  wish leads to a major disaster, and Sosuke, who promised to
                  protect Ponyo forever, faces a new challenge.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Despite Ponyo's seemingly outdated mermaid concept, lacking
                  grand visuals, epic stories, or profound revelations, it
                  exemplifies the charm of Hayao Miyazaki's animations, helping
                  viewers rediscover the most beautiful and pure things they
                  once had. Unlike traditional mermaids, Ponyo is unique. The
                  film is a narrative set in "an era of panic and unease," about
                  the emotions of boys and girls, love and responsibility, the
                  sea and life, and the relationship between fathers and sons.
                  Compared to Miyazaki's previous works, the film's worldview
                  and theme are somewhat simpler, but it deeply touches on the
                  theme of paternal love, reflecting Miyazaki's profound
                  feelings towards his own son.
