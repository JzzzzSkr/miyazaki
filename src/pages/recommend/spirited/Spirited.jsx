                  <strong>"Spirited Away"</strong> is an animated film produced
                  by Studio Ghibli and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. The main
                  voice cast includes Rumi Hiiragi, Miyu Irino, Takashi Naito,
                  and Mari Natsuki. The film premiered in Japan on July 20,
                  2001, and in mainland China on June 21, 2019, and tells the
                  story of a young girl named Chihiro who accidentally enters
                  the world of spirits and undergoes numerous trials to save her
                  parents, who have been transformed into pigs as punishment. A
                  digitally remastered version was re-released in Taiwan on
                  August 5, 2022.

                  <br />
                  Chihiro, a somewhat spoiled 10-year-old girl (voiced by Rumi
                  Hiiragi), is moving to a new home with her parents. On the
                  way, they accidentally enter a shrine leading to another
                  world: a bustling bathhouse street serving gods and spirits.
                  Her parents, having eaten food meant for the gods, are turned
                  into pigs. Chihiro, in a panic, is saved by a boy named Haku
                  (voiced by Miyu Irino). With Haku's help, Chihiro finds refuge
                  and works for the witch Yubaba (voiced by Mari Natsuki), who
                  runs the town's central bathhouse. In order to save her
                  parents and return to her own world, Chihiro must work for
                  Yubaba, who takes her name and renames her "Sen." During her
                  time there, she is guided by Lin (voiced by Yumi Tamai),
                  helped by Kamaji the boiler man (voiced by Bunta Sugawara),
                  encounters creatures like the soot sprites and the mysterious
                  No-Face, and makes many new friends. Ultimately, Chihiro saves
                  Haku and discovers his true identity. However, to save her
                  parents, she must face a severe test.

                  The film narrates Chihiro's journey of facing society alone
                  and growing up, serving as a "growth gift" from Miyazaki to
                  audiences of all ages. Particularly relevant during exam
                  seasons, "Spirited Away" is like a rite of passage into
                  adulthood. The first stage of growth involves entering an
                  unfamiliar environment and feeling panicked, much like
                  Chihiro's initial reaction to the spirit world. The second
                  stage is about facing temptations and making choices,
                  symbolized by characters like No-Face, who becomes a monster,
                  and Chihiro, who stays true to herself. The final stage
                  represents the inevitable goodbyes of growth, like the one-way
                  train in the movie, symbolizing that people can only accompany
                  you for part of your journey, and you must bid farewell when
                  they depart.
